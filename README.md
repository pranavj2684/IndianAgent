A Digital assistant

In this project I have developed an Android Application with an aim of providing a digital assitance to those people who are
not so technically sound but know how to use a basic android application. Usually people find it hard in India to complete any application 
online using Web Browser. From 2014, Digital India a great initiative by Modi Government to make all required and important document application
online, bypassing all the problems and hurdles a common man has to face fot applying to any important document because of Human intervention.
This Application holds functionality such as :
1)Download your Aadhar Card,
2)Apply for new Aadhar card, 
3)Check your Aadhar card status, 
4)Generate NRI Passport,
5)Generate Regular passport, 
6)Steps to generate passport, 
7)Passport Fee calculator, Know Nearby Police Station
8)Link Aadhar-Pan Card and also additional functionality of Bill Payment

NOTE: Every feature in this application directs user to the respective authenticated website of Indian Aadhar card, Passport and Bill
payment website. Segregation of functionalities is done so as to provide an ease while applying for passport, aadhar or bill payment.
Every link is opened in a webview. This app does not holds or saves or generates or manipulates or tampers user data. This is a simple Web view
Android application.
